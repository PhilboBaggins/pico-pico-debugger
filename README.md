TODO
----

* Photo of completed board
* Add silkscreen lines linking the breadboard style pads that are linked by traces
* Better footprint for SMT Pico board:
    * needs keepouts for pads on bottom of Pico
    * needs cutouts for USB connector
* 3D models for Pico boards
* More room for serial number and build date?
* Documentation
